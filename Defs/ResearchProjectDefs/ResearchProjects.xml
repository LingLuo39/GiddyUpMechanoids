	<description>This module functions as both a saddle and an interface to the mechanoid on which it is installed, allowing colonists to ride it to battle, given that there isn't already a turret mounted to the mechanoid. Can only be installed on mechanoids allowed to be used as mount in the mod options of Giddy-up! Battle Mechs.</description>
